# card-diff-list
An UI component, shown as a portfolio piece

This is a web component I developed while working for Bionamic and it's shared here in agreement with the company.

It is a list of "cards" that compares two bidimensional arrays  containing key value pairs.

Each card lists the keys of the two arrays and displays the values in the same line if the key is common for the two arrays. It basically shows the differences and similarities between them.

It's been made with the idea of comparing new and old values for the arrays that could be associated at a higher level with an id.
