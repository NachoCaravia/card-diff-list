# card-diff-list
A UI component shown as portfolio

This is a web component I made working for Bionamic and shared it here with the agreement of the company.

It is a list of "cards" that compare two bidimensional arrays, containing key value pairs.

Each card list the keys of the two arrays and display the values in the same line, if the key is common for the two arrays. It basically shows the differences and similarities between them.

It's been made with the idea of comparing new and old values for the arrays that could be associated at a higher level with an id.
